## Optimization Recommendations

### For Drug Design Workflows

#### Virtual Screening Optimization
```python
# Batch processing for high-throughput screening
batch_size = 1000  # molecules
expected_throughput = 100 * batch_size  # poses per batch
screening_time = total_compounds / expected_throughput
```

#### Memory Management
- **Available GPU Memory**: 20GB is excellent for large molecular systems
- **Recommendation**: Process proteins up to ~50,000 atoms simultaneously
- **Batch Strategy**: Group similar-sized molecules for efficiency

#### Kinetic Simulation Scaling
```python
# Optimal parameters based on your performance
optimal_replicas = 16  # Scale up from current 8
max_states = 200      # Your system can handle larger networks
target_steps = 100000  # Increase for production runs
```

### Production Deployment Strategy

#### High-Throughput Screening Setup
1. **Parallel Docking**: Run 4-6 concurrent docking processes
2. **GPU Memory Allocation**: Allocate 3-4GB per process
3. **Expected Throughput**: 400-600 poses/second total

#### Large-Scale Kinetic Simulations
1. **Network Size**: Scale to 500+ states for complex binding pathways
2. **Replica Count**: Increase to 32-64 replicas for better statistics
3. **Simulation Time**: Extend to microsecond timescales

## Benchmarking Schedule

### Regular Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Weekly performance check
python scripts/run_benchmarks.py --quick --output ./weekly_benchmarks

# Monthly comprehensive benchmark
