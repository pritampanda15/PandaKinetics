# PandaKinetics: Comprehensive Ligand Analysis Platform

## Core Capabilities for Any Ligand

### 1. **Kinetic Binding Analysis** 
Unlike traditional docking that gives you a single "best" pose, PandaKinetics provides:

```python
# Example workflow for any SMILES input
ligand_smiles = "CC(C)CC1=CC=C(C=C1)C(C)C(=O)O"  # Ibuprofen

# Full kinetic analysis
results = simulator.analyze_ligand(
    ligand_smiles=ligand_smiles,
    target_protein="protein.pdb",
    simulation_time=1e-6,  # microseconds
    n_replicas=16
)

# Key outputs
print(f"Binding events: {len(results.binding_times)}")
print(f"Unbinding events: {len(results.unbinding_times)}")
print(f"Residence time: {results.mean_residence_time}")
print(f"Association rate: {results.kon}")
print(f"Dissociation rate: {results.koff}")
```

### 2. **Transition State Discovery**
**Critical for drug design**: PandaKinetics maps the entire binding pathway

```python
# Transition network analysis
transition_network = results.get_transition_network()

# Key binding intermediates
for state_id, state in enumerate(transition_network.states):
    print(f"State {state_id}:")
    print(f"  Energy: {state.energy:.2f} kcal/mol")
    print(f"  Contacts: {state.protein_contacts}")
    print(f"  RMSD from bound: {state.rmsd_bound:.2f} Ã…")
```

### 3. **Drug-Specific Predictions**

#### **Selectivity Analysis**
```python
# Multi-target analysis
targets = ["COX1.pdb", "COX2.pdb"]  # For NSAIDs
selectivity_profile = simulator.analyze_selectivity(
    ligand_smiles=ligand_smiles,
    targets=targets
)
```

#### **ADMET Integration**
```python
# Kinetic ADMET properties
admet_results = simulator.predict_admet_kinetics(
    ligand_smiles=ligand_smiles,
    targets=["CYP3A4.pdb", "hERG.pdb", "PGP.pdb"]
)
```

## Practical Applications by Drug Class

### **Small Molecule Drugs**
- **Kinase Inhibitors**: Residence time optimization for selectivity

- **Cooperativity analysis**: Multi-site binding effects
- **Conformational states**: Protein dynamics during ligand binding

## Transition State PDB Export Capabilities

### **Structure Output System**

Based on the transition network architecture, here's what should be possible:

```python
# Export transition states as PDB complexes
def export_transition_states(results, output_dir="transition_states/"):
    """
    Export all transition states as PDB complexes with metadata
    """
    
    network = results.transition_network
    
    for state_id, state in enumerate(network.states):
        # Generate PDB complex
        complex_pdb = generate_complex_structure(
            protein_coords=state.protein_coordinates,
            ligand_coords=state.ligand_coordinates,
            ligand_smiles=results.ligand_smiles
        )
        
        # PDB file with metadata
        pdb_file = f"{output_dir}/state_{state_id:03d}.pdb"
        with open(pdb_file, 'w') as f:
            # Header with kinetic data
            f.write(f"HEADER    TRANSITION STATE {state_id}\n")
            f.write(f"REMARK    LIGAND SMILES: {results.ligand_smiles}\n")
            f.write(f"REMARK    STATE ENERGY: {state.energy:.3f} kcal/mol\n")
            f.write(f"REMARK    RESIDENCE PROB: {state.probability:.6f}\n")
            f.write(f"REMARK    BINDING CONTACTS: {len(state.contacts)}\n")
            
            # Standard PDB coordinates
            f.write(complex_pdb)
        
        # Companion metadata file
        metadata = {
            "state_id": state_id,
            "ligand_smiles": results.ligand_smiles,
            "energy_kcal_mol": state.energy,
            "probability": state.probability,
            "protein_contacts": state.contacts,
            "transition_rates": state.transition_rates,
            "rmsd_from_bound": state.rmsd_bound,
            "rmsd_from_unbound": state.rmsd_unbound
        }
        
        json_file = f"{output_dir}/state_{state_id:03d}_metadata.json"
        with open(json_file, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(metadata, f, indent=2)

# Usage
export_transition_states(results, "ibuprofen_cox2_transitions/")
```

### **Visualization Integration**

```python
# PyMOL visualization script generation
def generate_pymol_script(transition_dir):
    """Generate PyMOL script to visualize binding pathway"""
    
    script = """
# Load all transition states
load transition_states/state_*.pdb
    
# Color by energy (blue=low, red=high)
spectrum b, blue_red, all
    
# Show binding pathway animation
set movie_panel, 1
mplay

# Highlight key interactions
show sticks, ligand
show lines, (protein and (neighbor ligand))
    """
    
    with open(f"{transition_dir}/visualize_pathway.pml", 'w') as f:
        f.write(script)
```

## Integration with Drug Discovery Workflows

### **ChEMBL/PubChem Integration**
```python
# High-throughput screening
compound_ids = ["CHEMBL25", "CHEMBL1642", "CHEMBL1743"]  # Known drugs

for compound_id in compound_ids:
    smiles = get_smiles_from_chembl(compound_id)
    
    # Full kinetic analysis
    results = simulator.analyze_ligand(smiles, "target.pdb")
    
    # Export structures
    export_transition_states(results, f"results/{compound_id}/")
    
    # Store kinetic data
    kinetic_db.store_results(compound_id, results)
```

### **Lead Optimization Pipeline**
```python
# Structure-Kinetics Relationship (SKR) analysis
def optimize_residence_time(parent_smiles, target_residence_time):
    """
    Optimize ligand for target residence time
    """
    
    # Analyze parent
    parent_results = simulator.analyze_ligand(parent_smiles, "target.pdb")
    
    # Identify rate-limiting transitions
    bottleneck_states = find_bottleneck_transitions(parent_results)
    
    # Generate analogs targeting these states
    analogs = generate_targeted_analogs(
        parent_smiles, 
        target_states=bottleneck_states
    )
    
    # Screen analogs
    optimized_compounds = []
    for analog_smiles in analogs:
        results = simulator.analyze_ligand(analog_smiles, "target.pdb")
        
        if results.residence_time > target_residence_time:
            optimized_compounds.append({
                "smiles": analog_smiles,
                "residence_time": results.residence_time,
                "transition_states": export_transition_states(results)
            })
    
    return optimized_compounds
```

## Real-World Drug Discovery Impact

### **For Pharmaceutical Companies**
